For the final project of Web Development Portfolio assignment i used HTML and CSS to create a landing page with some hover animations and also made it responsive i started out by building the basic frame work in the Html and then linked the reset.css file to remove any existing css applied by the browser further more i linked my main.css to style my html. After which i had to make the media query to make the landing page responsive. During the process of building the website on css i had faced few challenges linking the nth child element and also while using the grid template area in the Services section. I reffered to the IMDC learning material to refresh some of the concepts during the development process to over the said challenges
